# A NFT collector's handbook

<blockquote> Building a collection involves finding, buying, organizing, and storing objects in a room, a house, a library, a museum, or a warehouse... It is also, inevitably, a way of thinking about the world... Collectioning, is a method of producing knowledge.

  â€” Hans Ulrich Obrist, *Ways of Curating*
